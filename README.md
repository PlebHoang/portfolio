So, my first portfolio was a mess.

It was this big, complicated "Multiverse" thing with glitched-out hexagons and a whole backstory about "system integrity." 

It was fun to build—pure JavaScript, lots of physics—but let's be honest, no hiring manager was going to sit through that.

This version is what happened when I took that experiment and tried to make it professional.

The "Spider-Web" is still here. 

The five main projects are locked into a stable formation, but everything else—the smaller achievements, the credentials—they all drift in a random orbit around the core. 

Every time you load the page, a physics engine runs in the background to make sure nothing overlaps.

It's my attempt to show how I think about engineering: you start with a chaotic, interesting problem, and you keep refining it until it's stable, readable, and gets the job done.

Ps. Have fun finding out an easter egg ;)
